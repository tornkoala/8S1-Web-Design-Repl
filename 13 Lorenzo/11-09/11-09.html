What will your website be about?
I'm going to just put a bunch of art that I have made over the years. Kind of like an art gallery.


What would be it's hypothetical domain name that's available?
I searched, and I think I would like this one: lartdelo.com. It is read l'art-de-lo. It is french for Art of Lo, and I am Lo. Lorenzo = Lo
