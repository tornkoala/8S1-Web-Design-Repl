        <p>I love Halloween for so many reasons, you get a lot of candy from trick or treating, you get to dress up all spooky and that is my favourite part. When I used to live in Germany, my whole neighborhood used to dress up,and people used to decoarate the outside of their houses, and then me and my friends would be out getting candy till 10 pm. I added this image of a skeleton on a skateboard because that is a very cool costume and something that reminds me of how spooky my neighborhood would look like during halloween.</p>
