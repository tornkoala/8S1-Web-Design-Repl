    Suha - Why I like halloween
  </h1>

  <h2>
    the first reason is simple, because halloween is awesome. since most of the year's event all have background stories and knowledge that we somehow get forced to learn about in school, i like that halloween is just a free-for-all day where you dress up, buy candy, give away candy, and are free to do anything scary. it doesn't have a reason, and if it does, no one's forcing me to learn about it, which i very much appreciate
  </h2>

<h2>
  my second reason is also simple:
  candy
